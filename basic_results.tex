\section{Some basic definitions/results}

This chapter will introduce some of the basic results, definition which will be necessary to start discussing the representability.
(But I started to think that there may not be too many results I need...)

\begin{thm}
All maximal independent sets have the same size.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
The rank of a matroid is the size of a maximal independent set.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
The rank of a column matroid is equal to the rank of the matrix.
\end{defn}
