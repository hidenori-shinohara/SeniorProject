* Prove the theorem 2.8 (intro_to_representability.tex)

* Finding excluded minors seems to be very very difficult.
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota's_conjecture

* The Fano matroid is one of the excluded minors of F3 and F5
  * Is the Fano matroid always an excluded minors of a finite field of characteristic != 2?
  * Let F be a field of characteristic not 2.
  * We know that the Fano matroid is not representable over F
  * Is every minor of the Fano matroid representable over F?
    * Actually yes (as long as the Fano plane is "symmetric")

* Projective plane of F3
  * Too much
