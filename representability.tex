\section{More discussion on matroid representability}
This chapter will be directly about matroid representability.

\begin{thm}
If a matroid $M = (E, \mathcal{I})$ only contains at most 3 non-loop elements, it is regular.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
meh
\end{proof}


\begin{defn}
Fano matroid.  A set of vertices is independent if it has at most three points and is not a line.
\end{defn}


\begin{thm}
Fano plane is representable over $F_2$, but not anything else.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
meh
\end{proof}


Possible topics I am thinking of discussing


\begin{itemize}
\item (Sketch of) proofs of some small cases of Rota's conjecture
\item List of interesting matroids that are not representable
\end{itemize}
