\section{More discussion on matroid representability}
I am planning to write several chapters about matroid representability.
Some ideas I have at this point include:

\begin{itemize}
\item (Sketch of) proofs of some small cases of Rota's conjecture
\item List of interesting matroids that are not representable
\end{itemize}
